Wiggle
------

Wiggle is a game development library/framework for Scala that uses LWJGL and
hence OpenGL and OpenAL for visualization and noise making.

It aspires to contain the following components (and probably more as I
undertake ever more sophisticated experiments):

- resource loading and management (image and sound data, textures) (in progress)
- 2D scene graph (vector, image and text rendering) (in progress)
- entities and tasks for simulation and animation (in progress)
- particle effect system (not started)
- sound effect and music playback (not started)

Some day Wiggle will be useful for actual game development, but presently it's
main purpose in life is to allow me to experiment with new and/or more succinct
ways to express the myriad APIs that go into game development.

I hope with Wiggle to achieve the same "scalability" (simple things are simple
and succinct, powerful things are possible and not much more complex) that
Scala has enabled in other programming domains.

Building
--------

You need three things:

1. Ant (1.7 or newer) - http://ant.apache.org/
2. Scala (2.7.2 or newer) - http://scala-lang.org/
3. LWJGL (2.0.1 or newer) - http://lwjgl.org/

Copy build.properties.dist to build.properties and specify the paths to your
Scala and LWJGL installations and then run:

% ant -Ddemo=Easing demo

to build the library and execute a demonstration program.

Building has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X and will probably not work on
Windows, though that should be easily accomplished with a small bit of ant
fiddling in the "test" task.
